# 🎓 Student Management System (High School Final Project)
# Graded 100/100

This repository contains a **Python-based student management system** developed as my **high school final project**.  
It is preserved to demonstrate my **early experience with GUI applications, databases, and full CRUD systems**.

> ⚠️ This project does **not represent my current coding standards**.  
> It is included to show learning progression and long-term interest in software engineering.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The application is a **desktop-based student portal** that allows users to manage student records through a graphical interface.

### Core features include:
- Secure login system
- Add, view, search, update, and delete student records
- MySQL database integration
- GUI built with CustomTkinter
- Text-to-speech feedback for user actions

The system demonstrates early understanding of **event-driven programming**, **database-backed applications**, and **user interface design**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- CustomTkinter (GUI)
- MySQL
- `mysql-connector-python`
- `pyttsx3` (text-to-speech)

## 🧩 Functionalities

- **Login Panel**
  - Simple authentication system
- **Student Portal**
  - Search students by ID or name
  - View all students in a scrollable table
  - Add new student records
  - Update existing student details
  - Delete student records
- **Voice Feedback**
  - Audio confirmations for login and logout actions

## 🗄️ Database Structure

The application connects to a MySQL database containing a `details` table with fields such as:
- ID
- Name
- Age
- Grade
- Section

> Note: Database credentials are hard-coded as this was an educational project.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- This project was built in an academic context and lacks modern best practices such as:
  - Environment variable usage
  - Secure authentication
  - Separation of concerns (MVC)
  - Input validation
- Credentials are hard-coded and **should not be used in production systems**
- The code is intentionally left mostly unchanged to preserve its educational value
